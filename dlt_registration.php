                		<b>1. What happens if my enterprise does not register for DLT compliance?</b>
                	</p>

                	<p>
                		<b>Answer:</b> We at Pride Web Technologies make every effort possible to make sure we provide our clients with uninterrupted service. However, as an SMS aggregator, we have to comply by the requirements of the network operators (Airtel, BSNL, etc.). Therefore, in the near future, should the network operators implement stricter rules for compliance with the TCCCPR, then your services maybe discontinued. Which is why we recommend you register your enterprise as soon as possible.

                		<b>2. What is DLT or Blockchain?</b>
                	</p>

                	<p>
                		<b>Answer:</b> By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">Read more</a>

                	</p>

                	<p>
                		<b>Answer:</b> TCCCPR (Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations) is a set of new regulations introduced by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) on 19th July 2018.

                		<b>4. Will it cost me to register?</b>
                	</p>

                	<p>
                		<b>Answer:</b> You maybe charged by the network operator that you register under. The charges depend upon the operators and the entire process may take upto 72 hours or more. Please contact the network operator of your choice to know more.
